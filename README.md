# Hand Gesture Recognition with CNN

This project implements a **Hand Gesture Recognition** system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the [LeapGestRecog](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) dataset. The model classifies grayscale 128Ã—128 images of hands into multiple gesture categories.  
It includes dataset download, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and an export-ready model for real-time inference.
